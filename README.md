JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains a series of small web projects built with JavaScript, designed to demonstrate and improve my understanding of core JavaScript concepts and client-side interactivity.

The focus is on applying foundational JavaScript skills such as:

DOM manipulation

Event handling

Data structures and logic

Working with forms and user input

Basic animations and effects

Fetch API and asynchronous behavior

These projects are intentionally kept simple to highlight JavaScript logic and interactivity, rather than relying on external libraries or complex frameworks. My goal is to write clean, modular, and maintainable JS code while learning through hands-on experimentation.

As I continue building, this repository will grow with new projects that reflect my learning journey and improvements.
